immutable means:- unchangable....

java is IMMUTABLE because java follows a string pool where it puts all the strings for reusability...

if we change a string then it will make another string of that new name and put it in string pool...

string s="john";
s="carl"  it works but it does not change litrally...it just makes a new string named "carls" and points s->"calrl"...hence IMMUTABLE;

cpp is MUTABLE...for memory efficiency and easy debugging..
